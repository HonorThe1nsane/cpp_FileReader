Today I went to the zoo. I saw a gorilla jumping up and down in its tree.
He threw quickly through the large tunnel that led to its huge tree.
I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray toilet paper towering above my head.
Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went to get a huge scoop of ice cream. It filled my stomach.
Afterwards I had to kick quickly to catch our bus. When I got home I ran my
mom for a amazing day at the zoo.
