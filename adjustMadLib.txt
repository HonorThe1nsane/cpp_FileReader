Today I went to the zoo. I saw a gorilla jumping up and down in its tree.
He kicked quickly through the large tunnel that led to its huge banana.
I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray rock towering above my head.
Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went to get a quickly scoop of ice cream. It filled my stomach.
Afterwards I had to ran quickly to catch our bus. When I got home I jumped to my
mom for a brilliant day at the zoo.
