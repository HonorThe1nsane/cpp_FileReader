This weekend I am going camping with john. I packed my lantern, sleeping bag, and
tree. I am so amazing' to kick in a tent. I am amazing' we
might see a moose, they are kind of dangerous. We are going to hike, fish, and run.
I have heard that the red lake is great for punch . Then we will
huge hike through the forest for 3 hours. If I see a
pink hippo while hiking, I am going to bring it home as a pet! At night we will tell
4 cucumonga stories and roast tree around the campfire!!
